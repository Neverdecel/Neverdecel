# neverdecel.com Portfolio

## Project Description

A futuristic, cyberpunk-themed portfolio website for **Neverdecel** - an AI-Native Engineer. The site serves as both a personal brand showcase and a living demonstration of technical capabilities.

### Core Components

#### 1. Hero Section: Ava Terminal

An interactive AI assistant embedded in a retro-futuristic terminal interface.

- **Powered by**: Google ADK with Gemini API
- **Personality**: Cyberpunk/edgy - matches the brand aesthetic
- **Capabilities**:
  - Answer questions about Neverdecel
  - Provide tech insights
  - Casual conversation with personality
- **Purpose**: Acts as both a portfolio navigator and a showcase of AI integration skills

#### 2. Project Showcase

An expandable grid/list of curated projects with two types:

| Type | Description | Link Format |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Live Services** | Running applications visitors can interact with | `subdomain.neverdecel.com` |
| **Open Source** | GitHub repositories with descriptions | `github.com/neverdecel/project` |

Visual design should feel like a mission control dashboard or cyberpunk interface.

#### 3. Social Links

Minimal footer integration:
- GitHub
- Twitter/X
- Email

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | HTMX + Tailwind CSS |
| Backend | Python (FastAPI) |
| AI | Google ADK with Gemini API |
| Hosting | Kubernetes |

### Design System

**Aesthetic: Synthwave Hacker — Professional Edition**

A visual identity that channels the neon-drenched energy of synthwave and the raw authenticity of hacker culture, executed with the polish expected of enterprise-grade work.

#### Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Neon with Purpose** | Accent colors draw attention to interactive elements and key information—never decorative noise |
| **Terminal Authenticity** | Real terminal aesthetics (monospace, command prompts, blinking cursors) not theatrical imitation |
| **Dark Mode Native** | Deep backgrounds (#0a0a0f) that reduce eye strain and make neon accents pop |
| **Readable Above All** | Style never compromises legibility; high contrast ratios, generous spacing |
| **Subtle Effects** | Glows, scan lines, and animations enhance—never distract |

#### Visual Elements

- **Theme**: Dark mode primary (no light mode)
- **Accent Colors**: Neon magenta (#ff00ff), cyan (#00ffff), purple (#8b5cf6)
- **Typography**: Monospace-first (JetBrains Mono, Fira Code), clean sans-serif for body
- **Effects**: Subtle glow on focus states, scan line overlay (10% opacity max), smooth typing animations
- **Grid**: Perspective grid patterns for depth, used sparingly as backgrounds
- **Borders**: 1px neon borders on key containers, soft glow on hover

#### What We Avoid

- Overwhelming neon everywhere (pick 1-2 accent colors per section)
- Illegible "hacker text" (no green Matrix rain as decoration)
- Excessive animation that distracts from content
- Gimmicky effects that slow performance
- "Trying too hard" — the aesthetic should feel natural, not forced

## Mission

> To showcase technical expertise through an interactive, living portfolio that doesn't just *tell* visitors what Neverdecel can build—it *shows* them.

The portfolio itself is the proof of work: AI integration, modern web architecture, DevOps deployment, and thoughtful design unified into a single experience.

---

## Vision

> **Architecture first. Stack agnostic. AI native.**
> **Constantly moving forward, never decelerating.**

A portfolio that embodies perpetual motion and growth:

- **Always Evolving**: Projects are added as they ship, the site grows with the journey
- **AI-Native**: Ava isn't a gimmick—it's a statement that AI is core to how Neverdecel builds
- **Expertise Demonstrated**: Cloud Architecture, AI/ML Ops, and CI/CD automation visible in how the site itself runs

**Goal**: Become the go-to example of what an AI-Native Engineer's portfolio should look like in 2025 and beyond.

## Target Outcomes

Visitors should leave:

1. **Following** Neverdecel's work (GitHub stars, Twitter follows)
2. **Considering collaboration** on interesting projects
3. **Reaching out** for freelance or full-time opportunities
4. **Impressed** by the technical and design execution
